# Write a method, filter_lengths(strings, length), that accepts an array of strings
# and a length as args. The method should return an array containing the strings
# that have at least the given length. The length argument should be optional; if no length
# is passed in, then 5 should be used as the length.

    #---Iterating through each string comparing the length of each to our
    #---length variable and shoveling into it appropriate words of length
    strings.each do |str|
      if str.length >= length
        words << str
      end
    end
    #---finally we return the array of words matching our conditions
    return words
end
