# To implement Bubble Sort in Ruby, we'll need to perform this operation,
#  so let's explore it in isolation. A key detail is that we may need an 
#  extra temporary variable to store one of the elements since we will be 
#  overwriting them in the array:

array = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]    # let's swap "a" and "b"
temp = array[0];                # save a copy of the first ele
array[0] = array[1];            # overwrite the first ele with the second ele
array[1] = temp;                # overwrite the second ele with the first ele copy
p array          # => ["b", "a", "c", "d"]

# It worked! But hmmm, using that temp variable was kind of messy. Is 
# there an easier way to swap elements of an array? Yep! Ruby has many 
# clean shortcuts:

array = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]    # let's swap "a" and "b"
array[0], array[1] = array[1], array[0]
p array         # => ["b", "a", "c", "d"]

# As a side note: you can use this swapping mechanic for entire variables as well

food = "mom's spaghetti"
clothing = "sweater"

food, clothing = clothing, food

p food      # => "sweater"   
p clothing  # => "mom's spaghetti"

# Bubble Sort Ruby Implementation
# Using swap and our newfound understanding of Bubble Sort, 
# let's code! Take a look at the snippet below and try to understand 
# how it corresponds to our conceptual understanding of the algorithm.
#  Scroll down to the commented version when you get stuck.

def bubble_sort(array)
    sorted = false  # when this var is false, that means the array is not fully sorted yet

    while !sorted       # while the array is not sorted...
        sorted = true       # reset the sorted flag to true 

        # the each below will perform a single 'pass' of bubble sort
        (0...array.length - 1).each do |i|
            if array[i] > array[i + 1]                              # if adjacent elements are out of order...
                array[i], array[i + 1] = array[i + 1], array[i]     #   then swap their positions
                sorted = false                                      # since we just made a swap, we may need to perform
            end                                                     # an additional 'pass', so set the flag to false
        end
    end

        sorted = true
